                    I am a puzzle solver, twisting around the pecies and learning new strategies to                     solve a problem is an extremely rewarding proccess for me. All my life I have been doing
                    puzzles from legos to math and even people. "Knowledge is power" may be a cliche phrase
                    but it's 100% true and I live by it. I plan on running my own company someday in what I'm
                    not quite sure, but I know thats what I want and whatever it takes to learn I will.
